## What is this repo about ?

Le Wagon is hereby curating a selected list of useful **open-source templates** for data analysis / data science.

These templates should be:

✅ self-explanatory
✅ replicable (provided Le Wagon [data-setup](https://github.com/lewagon/data-setup) has been done on the machine)
✅ focused on one specific theme

A theme could be:
- A **project boilerplate**: A typical 2 weeks-long / 4 students project in the spirit of what is done at [Le Wagon Data Science bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com/data-science-course/full-time)
  - e.g. "Time-Series cross-validation boilerplate"
  - e.g. "Reinforcement Learning boilerplate"
  - e.g. "Image classification trainer + streamlit API boilerplate"
  - ...


- A **how to** guide focused on one specific topic worth sharing
  - e.g. "Removing bottlenecks with Numba, Cython, and TensorFlow"
